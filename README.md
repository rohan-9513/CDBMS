# CDBMS
This project is basically a mini database management system (DBMS) implemented in Java. It simulates the core operations of a relational database (like MySQL, Oracle, etc.) but stores data in memory (using a LinkedList&lt;Employee>) and provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
